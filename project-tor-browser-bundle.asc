Tor Browser Bundle is a bundle containing different tor components
bundled in a tarball :

 - the tor browser

 - the tor daemon

 - tor launcher

 - tor button

 - https everywhere

 - noscript

It is built for Windows, Linux (x86 and x86_64), Windows.

The different branches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TBB 2.x.x
+++++++++
The scripts to build the 2.x.x versions of the bundle are in the
https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/[torbrowser.git] repository.

The Windows and Mac OS X versions were built natively on Windows and
Mac OS X.

With the release of TBB 3.5, the TBB 2.x.x branch is now deprecated and
won't be used for new releases.

TBB 3.x.x
+++++++++
The main differences between TBB 2.x.x and TBB 3.x.x branches are :

- bundle builds are now reproducible

- the Windows and Mac OS X versions are cross compiled

- Vidalia is no longer used to start the tor daemon and browser. It is
  replaced by tor launcher. Vidalia is still available as an addon that
  can be downloaded separately.

The scripts to build the bundle are now located in the
https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git[builders/tor-browser-bundle.git]
repository.

Details about the build process can be found in the
https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build[gitian/README.build]
file.

// missing translations bug

{ticket}10444[#10444: TBB's Info.plist needs to be updated each release]::
	The file Info.plist included in the mac builds include some version
	numbers that should be updated for each new release. We should automate
	the update of this file this so that it's not forgotten.

Proposals
^^^^^^^^^

- Replace gitian with an other tool with more features, so that we don't
  need to use shell wrapper scripts around it. This should also make
  the build process more simple and more modular. This tool is described
  in the xref:proposal-build-tool[build tool section].

- The Bundle can currently only be built from Ubuntu. It would be nice
  to be able to launch the build from other Linux distributions, so that
  we don't have to run Ubuntu on the server that will do automated builds.
  This is reported in {ticket}10125[ticket #10125].

- After improving the build process, run automated builds from Jenkins
  when there are new commits in any of the components included in the
  bundle. A more modular build process allows us to rebuild only the
  parts that changed since the last build.

- Implement some automated tests and run them automatically after new
  builds.
