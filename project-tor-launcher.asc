Tor Launcher is a xul browser extension that is responsible for starting
the tor daemon in the Tor Browser Bundle.

Packaging
^^^^^^^^^
Tor Launcher is packaged as an xpi file (Mozilla extension file) which
is included in the Tor Browser Bundle.

The xpi file (a zip file) created by the Makefile is not currently
deterministic, so it has to be extracted and recreated in a deterministic
way during the bundle build.

Testing
^^^^^^^
Tor Launcher does not have tests yet.

Using Tor Launcher require the other components of the bundle, so it
can be difficult to test itself. It can be tested as part of Tor Browser
Bundle.

Proposals
^^^^^^^^^
minor change: make the xpi file created by the Makefile deterministic,
so it doesn't have to be recreated during TBB build.
