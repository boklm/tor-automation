The tor pluggable transports bundle is a bundle similar to the Tor Browser
Bundle, but which includes some pluggable transports:

- pyptlib (python pluggable transport library)

- obfsproxy

- flashproxy

Build Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The repository pluggable-transports/bundle.git contains the Makefile
that is used to build the 2.x.x series of the bundle. This Makefile
downloads the classical Tor Browser Bundle, extract it, add the pluggable
transports and a modified torrc configuration file, then create and sign
new tarballs.

With the 3.5 bundle release, the build process has been changed to use
gitian. A new pluggable-transports bundle has also been created using
gitian, using descriptors currently in the repository
user/dcf/tor-browser-bundle.git. This work is described in
{ticket}9444[ticket #9444].

Testing
^^^^^^^
The pluggable transports bundle does not currently have automated tests.

Proposals
^^^^^^^^^

- A proposal for a new build process is {proposal}#pttbb[described here].

- Automate build of PTTBB with Jenkins when there are new commits in
  any of its components, and keep an archive of recent builds

- Implement some automated tests for the pluggable transports, and run
  them on new commits
