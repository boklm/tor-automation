However, Isis Lovecruft has a personnal development fork on github that
is built and tested by travis-ci.org:
https://travis-ci.org/isislovecruft/bridgedb/

Packaging

virtualenv.

Testing

Some unit tests are implemented in 'lib/bridgedb/Tests.py' and can be
run with the command 'python setup.py test'.

Proposals

- Add BridgeDB build and test to Jenkins
