Continuous Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
BridgeDB is not currently built and tested by Jenkins.

However, Isis Lovecruft has a personnal development fork on github that
is built and tested by travis-ci.org:
https://travis-ci.org/isislovecruft/bridgedb/
The configuration file used by travis-ci is:
https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/isis/bridgedb.git/blob/refs/heads/develop:/.travis.yml

Packaging
^^^^^^^^^
BridgeDB does not have packages. It is currently deployed using a Python
virtualenv.

Testing
^^^^^^^
Some unit tests are implemented in 'lib/bridgedb/Tests.py' and can be
run with the command 'python setup.py test'.

Proposals
^^^^^^^^^

- Add BridgeDB build and test to Jenkins ({ticket}10417[#10417]). We
  should run the tests with multiple versions of python, and try to have
  coverage reports similar to https://coveralls.io/r/isislovecruft/bridgedb[coveralls.io],
  using the Jenkins https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin[Cobertura Plugin].
