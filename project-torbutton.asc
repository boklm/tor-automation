Torbutton is a firefox extension that is included with Tor browser as
part of the bundle.

Packaging
^^^^^^^^^
Torbutton is packaged as an xpi file (Mozilla extension file) which
is included in the Tor Browser Bundle.

The xpi file (a zip file) created by the the script ./makexpi.sh is not
currently deterministic, so it has to be extracted and recreated in a
deterministic way during the bundle build.

Testing
^^^^^^^
Torbutton does not have tests yet.

Some tests to check the main functionnalities of Torbutton could be
added. A possible tool to implement those tests can be
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozmill[MozMill] or one of the
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Automated_testing[other Mozilla frameworks].

Proposals
^^^^^^^^^
Add some tests to check the main functionnalities of Torbutton. Those
tests should be run as part of bundle testing.
