Testing
^^^^^^^
Tails have some automated tests to check different features. Some of
them are related to Tor.

The tests can be found in their git repository in the diretory
https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/tree/features[features].

The tests are written using the Cucumber tests framework. The GUI tests
are made using Sikuli.

An interesting test is the https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails/tree/features/torified_browsing.feature[
torified_browsing.feature] test checking that when visiting
http://check.torproject.org/ using the tor browser, all traffic flows
through tor.
