Jenkins Current Setup
+++++++++++++++++++++

Jenkins is configured using http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/[
Jenkins Job Builder]. This is a tool that allows configuring Jenkins
jobs using YAML files instead of the web interface. The Jenkins jobs
configuration is stored in the https://gitweb.torproject.org/project/jenkins/jobs.git[
jenkins/jobs.git] repository.

The https://gitweb.torproject.org/project/jenkins/tools.git[jenkins/tools.git]
repository contains scripts and tools to run the jobs.
