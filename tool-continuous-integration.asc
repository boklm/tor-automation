Jenkins
^^^^^^^

Jenkins Current Setup
+++++++++++++++++++++

Jenkins is configured using http://ci.openstack.org/jenkins-job-builder/[
Jenkins Job Builder]. This is a tool that allows configuring Jenkins
jobs using YAML files instead of the web interface. The Jenkins jobs
configuration is stored in the https://gitweb.torproject.org/project/jenkins/jobs.git[
jenkins/jobs.git] repository.

The https://gitweb.torproject.org/project/jenkins/tools.git[jenkins/tools.git]
repository contains scripts and tools to run the jobs.

Travis CI
^^^^^^^^^
Travis CI is an hosted continuous integration service. An open source
version that you can install on your own server is
https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/[also available]. However the
README file discourage doing that:
----
Travis CI is not currently a good fit for closed in-house installations.
It's made up of multiple applications which evolve rapidly. We are
working on providing a way to install a closed in-house installation,
but we have no ETA for this at the moment.

Pros
++++

- Free for open source projects

- Easy to use and good documentation

- Out of the box support for various languages and databases

Cons
++++

- Requires the git repository to be hosted on github

- You can't easily host your own instance

- It concentrates on the most common use cases. We don't control the server
  where it is hosted, so we are limited in what we can do.
