Continuous Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The master, maint-0.2.3, maint-0.2.4 branches are built automatically
by Jenkins :

- on different versions of Debian distributions (squeeze, wheezy, jessie,
  sid, lucid, precise, quantal, raring, saucy)

- on Debian sid with clang

- on Windows

Packaging
^^^^^^^^^
Tor is included in the Tor Browser Bundle.

Packages for the stable version of Tor are available in many Linux
distributions.

Some packages are also available on http://deb.torproject.org/ :

- nightly builds of Debian packages based on the tor master, maint-0.2.3,
  maint-0.2.4 branches are built automatically by Jenkins. Those packages
  are created using scripts in the
  https://gitweb.torproject.org/project/jenkins/tools.git[jenkins/tools.git]
  repository.

- RPM packages for Fedora 18, 19 and Red Hat EL 6, for the maint-0.2.4
  and master branches. The packages are built using the scripts from the
  https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/hiviah/rpm-build-scripts.git[
  user/hiviah/rpm-build-scripts.git] repository. The build is manually
  started, there is no nightly builds yet.

Testing
^^^^^^^
Tor includes 189 unit tests in C, testing individual functions used in
Tor. A few python scripts are also used to test some parts of Tor. Those
tests are run automatically by Jenkins after successful builds.

There is no integration tests that are run automatically yet. There is
the beginnings of a set of scripts to run integration tests using 
https://gitweb.torproject.org/chutney.git[chutney]. The script
'src/test/test-network.sh' can be used to bootstrap a Tor network.

Example Bugs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
TODO: find example of bugs that we would like to detect with automated
tests.

Proposals
^^^^^^^^^

- Implement a few integration tests, and make them run by Jenkins

- Add RPM continuous packaging
