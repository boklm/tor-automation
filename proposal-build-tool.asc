TODO: add description of this tool

The goal of this new build tool would be :

[[proposal-continuous-packaging]]

Package building::
	.

Tarball building::
	.

Continuous packaging::
.
////
	We can have tests to check for many potential problems, but we
	can't have tests for everything. Having some users acting as
	beta testers by using the developement version for their daily
	use would help finding more bugs before the release. Having
	packages available for the latest developement version will
	help interested users to use it and keep it updated.

Reproducible builds::
