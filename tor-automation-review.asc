Tor Automation Review
=====================

This document will review the current status about build process,
packaging, unit and integration testing of all projects that are part
of the tor project, and the tools that are currently used for those
tasks. It will try to list the main tasks that should be planned in the
near and distant future.

It should answer the following questions :

- What is the list of official tor projects, and their status regarding
  build (including deterministic build), testing and packaging automation ?

- What is the list of tools that we currently use and what are their
  limitations ? Which ones do we want to keep ? Which one do we want to
  replace, and what are the available alternatives ? Which new tools do
  we want to use, for which tasks ?

- What do we want to test ? What type of regressions do we want to avoid
  by having tests ? What are the main tests that we want to have ?

- What automation features do we want soon, and what do we want in long
  term ?
