Automation Proposals
====================

This document describe the main proposals for automating the build and
tests of tor projects.

Build tool::
	This proposal describe a new build process for TBB, PTTBB and packages.
	An advanced prototype of a TBB / PTTBB build process is available to
	show how that would work. This new process would make it possible to
	automate the build of bundles in Jenkins.

VM / Containers tools::
	This proposal describe an tool that would help us create and manage
	virtual machines. It would be used during the build process, and during
	the automated testing.

Builds Database::
	This proposal describes a signed builds database. This allows us to
	automate the upload, download and verification of build signatures.
	We can then integrate it into the build process so that the parts that
	have already been built by enough trusted people are not built again.

Test Helpers::
	This proposal describes some tools that we should make to be able to
	automate the testing of some of the Tor components.
