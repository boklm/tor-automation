A tool that allows us to automatically create a VM image for a selected
distribution, configure it to run some tor software and start it would be useful.

It could be used in the following situtations:

Reproducible Builds::
	In order to make reproducible builds of Tor Browser Bundle, we need to
	build it in a reproducible environment. To do that, we run the build
	using a virtual machine or container of a Linux distribution (currently
	Ubuntu Lucid for Linux builds, and Ubuntu Precise for Windows and Mac
	OS X cross compiled builds). So we need to be able to create VM images,
	and start / stop them.

Automated Testing::
	We can do some unit testing on the host where we are building the
	software. However more advanced testing require some virtual machines
	or containers, especially if we need to test how different instances
	interact.

Tor Cloud images::
	Tor Cloud is a tool that helps in the creation of an Amazon EC2 image
	to host a tor bridge. If we have a tool that allows us to easily create
	and configure VM images which include tor software, then we could use
	that tool to create preconfigured VM images for various cloud providers.

Description of the tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It would be useful if we had a tool where we can use a command similar
to this:
----
$ vmtool create server1 --type kvm --os debian-wheezy --target tor-bridge \
         --tor-control-port 9151
----

To create a kvm image based on debian-wheezy with a tor daemon configured
as bridge with 9151 as the control port.

The VM could then be started, stopped, removed with:
----
$ vmtool start server1
$ vmtool stop server1
$ vmtool remove server1
----

How we can implement it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most of those features are already implemented in various other tools.
We just need a small wrapper around all those tools to provide all those
features from a single command.

The following features can be implemented with those tools:

Image Creation::
	We can create a chroot directory of a minimal install using deboostrap,
	yum or urpmi, depending on the selected distribution. For the
	distributions that don't have a similar tool, we can store an archive
	of a minimal chroot. We then need to convert this chroot directory to
	an image if we want to use something else than LXC.

Image Configuration::
	We need to take the minimal install that we have, and install some
	software and configure them according to the type of image that was
	requested. To do this we can use a configuration management tool such
	as Ansible. We'll need to implement the deployement of all tor projects
	in an Ansible repository. This repository will be useful to configure
	the VM images, but can also used by people who want to deploy some Tor
	software on their machines.

VM Management::
	Most of this can be handled using a tool such as libvirt.
