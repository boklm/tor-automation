In order to write some tests, we will need some test helpers to check
some functionalities. We will list here the tools that need to be
created.

[[helper-fingerprint]]
Fingerprint tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to make sure that tor browser is not leaking informations that
can be used for fingerprinting, testers visit https://panopticlick.eff.org/.

We need a tool that would be similar to panopticlick, but that output
the results in YAML (or other machine readable format), so that it can
be used in automated tests.

The testing would work like this, you load in torbrowser a URL that look
like this :

----
     http://fingerprint.tor-qa/new/[ID]
----

with ID replaced by a UUID or other random ID. The web application would
save all informations it can get from the web browser using HTTP headers.
Some javascript on the page would get some infos, and load some URLs
like this to transmit them to the webserver :

----
     http://fingerprint.tor-qa/save/[ID]?info_name=some_value
----

When the javascript on the page finished saving what it wanted to save,
it loads the following URL :

----
     http://fingerprint.tor-qa/finish/[ID]
----

And then the web server generate a report in YAML containing all the
infos it received, at the following URL :

----
     http://fingerprint.tor-qa/results/[ID]
----


A diff tool also needs to be created. It would take as input two YAML
files containing fingerprint informations, and show the difference for
the fields that are not expected to differ (ignoring things like screen
resolution which are expected to change).

This should make it possible to write some automated tests that compare
the fingerprint of a new tor browser with the fingerprint from a previous
version, and produce an error if it differs.

[[helper-identifier]]
Identifier tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to check that tor browser cookie protection is working as
expected. To help writting those tests, we need a website that store
cookies and tell us whether previous cookies are available, so we can
load this page during the tests.

This web site will :

- check if the cookie already exists

- try to save the cookie if it does not exist yet

- display on the page whether the cookie already exists and its value

Initial version would work with cookies only. Later versions could be
extended to also use other techniques for storing informations in
the browser :

[[helper-network]]
Network logging tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Something that we need to check is that tor browser, tor birdy and other
clients using tor do not leak network information by doing direct
connections when they should be using tor.

To do that we need a tool to monitor the network activity from a process
and log all non-tor activity.

There are different alternatives to implement this tool :
