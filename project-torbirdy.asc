TorBirdy is an extension that brings safe Tor support to Thunderbird.

Continuous Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
TorBirdy is not currently built by Jenkins. However, its current
build process is to zip the sources as an xpi file, so it has no reason
to fail.

Packaging
^^^^^^^^^
TorBirdy is distributed as an xpi file (a zip file containing the
sources of the plugin), to be installed with thunderbird.

There is no distribution package available yet. {ticket}6018[Ticket #6018]
is about creating a Debian package to add it to torproject.org repository,
and {ticket}8030[ticket #8030] is about adding it to Debian..

Testing
^^^^^^^
TorBirdy does not seem to have tests yet. It might be possible to
implement some tests using xpcshell.

Proposals
^^^^^^^^^

- When Debian packages are available, create nightly packages build
  (see {proposal}#proposal-continuous-packaging[continuous packaging proposal])

- Investigate implementation of tests using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MailNews/MailNews_Automated_Testing[xpcshell].
